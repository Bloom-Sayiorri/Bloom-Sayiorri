<h1>Hello, I'm Bloom Tauta</h1>

<p>
  I am a Fullstack Software Engineer from Nairobi, Kenya. I am capable of coming up with interactive and user friendly websites, to make the experience of surfing the web both fun and at the same time enjoyable.
  I am more inclined towards Frontend Development as I took it up to challenge myself to become a better developer. I started my tech journey late 2022, and so far I haven't looked back.
  It has been quite the journey and I'm hopegful for what the future holds.
